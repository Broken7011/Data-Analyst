Relational Databases store data in tables(relations)
Data is organized into rows(record) and columns (fields)

Tables are related through keys
Ensures data integrity and reduces redundancy.


# KEY CONCEPTS
Tables: Core structure for data storage
Primary Key: Uniquely identifies a record
Foreign Key: Establishes relationships between tables
SQL: Structured query language for database operations

# Normalization
Normalization organizes data to minimize redundancy
1NF: Eliminates duplicate columns
2NF: Remove subsets of data in multiple rows
3NF: Ensure all attributes depend only on the primary Key

# Advantages of Relational Databases:
Data integrity and accuracy 
Flexibility in data retrieval 
Support for transactions and concurrency 
Scalability and performance
