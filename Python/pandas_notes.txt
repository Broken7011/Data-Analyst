Pandas is a powerful python library for data manipulation and analysis
it provides data structures like series and dataFrame
Built on NumPy, it enables efficient handling of structured data
 > Support for missing data
 > Data filtering, merging and reshaping
 > Integration with other data analysis libraries

# SERIES: one dimensinal labeled array
# DATAFRAME: Two dimensional labeled array
>> OPERATIONS
Reading data from CSV, EXCEL , databases
Data cleaning , Handling missing values , duplicates
Data transformation: Sorting , filtering and grouping
Statistical functionsL mean median correlation

# A dataframe is a two dimensional, size-mutable and hetrogenous data structure in pandas
# It is similar to a table in SQL or an excel spreadsheet
# Provides labeled axes (rows and columns) for easy data manipulation

import pandas as pd
data = {"Name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Rish"],
        'Age': [25,30,100]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)

# Common Operations 
Viewwing Data: df.head(), df.tail()
Selecting Data: df['column_name'], df.iloc[0]
Filtering: df[df['Age'] >25]
AddingCOlumns: df['Salary] = [50000,60000]

# TO read a csv file
import pandas as pd 
df = pd.read_csv('data_csv.csv')
print(df)

# To read an excel file
import pandas as pd 
df = pd.read_excel('data_csv.xlsx')
print(df)

# To read json file
import pandas as pd  
df = pd.read_json('data.js')
print(df)
